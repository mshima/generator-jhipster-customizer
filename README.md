This blueprint will look for patches at the customizer folder on the root of your project.

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) blueprint, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

# Prerequisites

# Installation

To install this blueprint:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-customizer
```

# Usage

Features with name of the generator can conflict.
